        <p>Hello, there!</p>
        <p>
          First, I would love to thank you for your interest in the upcoming
          thesis writing training organised by Grace Hands Research Institute.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please, find below the things I've recently find out about project
          writing:
        </p>
        <li>
          Many supervisors don't have the time to tutor their students either
          undergraduate or post graduate students on thesis writing, but they
          expect excellent student projects. Research has it that they
          eventually publish students' project to their own credit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Most thesis submissions are now online due to restrictions on physical
          meetings, which implies an easy plagiarism check upon submission. Many
          students end up re-writing one chapter several times due to
          plagiarism.
        </li>
        <li>
          Also, many students don't know how to go about writing their projects,
          yet they find it difficult to ask for help, while others who asked for
          help end up being duped by quacks who no nothing about project
          writing. I try as much as possible to right these wrongs, but
          remember, ignorance is costly especially when you are trying to
          correct your mistakes.
        </li>
        <li>
          While some charge exorbitant rates for project writing, this Institute
          charges N40k - N50k for undergraduate works and a minimum of N150k for
          post graduate works with full plagiarism check. Nonetheless, our
          utmost priority is to satisfy our customers.
        </li>
        <p>
          Although, our true joy is in seeing our trainees write their theses on
          their own (because we train them enough to do so), you may still
          decide to outsource the skill after this training. Beyond that, every
          participant will be able to surmount any challenge in the process of
          project writing. Some of these challenges include: finding the
          required journal to use, getting a researchable topic and plagiarism
          reduction, writing literature review, citations and references etc
        </p>
        <p>Now that you know all of these, why waste any more time waiting?</p>
        <p>
          Always remember: proper training like this equips you and makes you
          better at project writing!
